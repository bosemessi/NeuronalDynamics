# End of the chapter questions. Question 1 has been done on Mathematica; rest are just easier to type up on Latex/Markdown as they are all analytical stuff.


## Qs 2. 

$` d^2u/dt^2 = (df/du) (du/dt) `$ For this to be zero at a point where $` du/dt `$ is not, $` df/du = 0`$, which defines the rheobase voltage value.
